        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>

                Cream shortening, peanut butter, and both sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer
                until light and fluffy. Beat in egg until incorporated. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder,
                and salt in a separate bowl; gradually stir into peanut butter mixture until combined.
                Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.

                Roll chilled dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets.
                Flatten dough balls with a fork dipped in flour to form a crosswise pattern.

                Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes.
                Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
