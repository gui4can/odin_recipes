    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This grilled tomahawk steak recipe is a showstopper, ideal for sharing with friends and family. This reverse-seared steak is cooked to perfection with an unctuous compound butter filled with shallots, garlic, and chives. I like to use a Bluetooth-enabled meat thermometer to help me achieve the perfect medium-rare internal temperature.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Montreal steak seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Montreal steak seasoning</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
        <li>1 (2 3/4 pound) tomahawk steak (3-inch thick bone-in ribeye)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced shallot</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons reserved steak rub</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>
            <p>
                To make steak rub, place brown sugar, Montreal steak seasoning, garlic powder,
                and onion powder in a small airtight container; shake or stir to combine. 
                Set aside 2 teaspoons steak rub to use in compound butter.

                For compound butter, place butter, shallot, garlic, chives, 
                and the reserved 2 teaspoons steak rub in a small bowl. 
                Mash together with a fork until evenly combined.
                Spoon butter into a small airtight container, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.

                Remove steak from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to take the chill off.
                It will cook on the sheet pan that you used for dry-brining.

            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). The reverse sear method is used to cook this big steak,
                so you will need an instant-read thermometer. If you are using a digital meat thermometer,
                set the internal temperature to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Bake steak on the sheet pan in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer
                inserted into the center reads 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), about 45 minutes.
                Begin checking the temperature at 30 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                During the last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking time,
                preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
